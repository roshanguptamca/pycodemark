Quick Start
# Quick Start with PyCodemark

PyCodemark is a **full-featured Python code review tool** that detects style issues, missing docstrings, and other code quality problems. It supports **terminal, JSON, and SARIF output** for CI integration.

## Installation

Install PyCodemark via pip:

```bash
pip install pycodemark
````
Or with Poetry:
```bash
poetry add pycodemark 
````
Run a basic code review:
```bash
codemark review src/
codemark review src/ --format json
codemark review src/ --format sarif    
```

Plugins

Extend PyCodemark by adding custom checks under src/codemark/plugins/.
Each plugin must implement:
```python`
def run(file_path, config):
    """Return a list of issues detected in the file."""
    return []
````
Pre-commit Integration

Add to your .pre-commit-config.yaml:
```yaml repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: codemark
        name: codemark-review
        entry: codemark review --format terminal
        language: system
        types: [python]     
```

Then run:
```bashpre-commit install
```pre-commit install
````
CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)

You can integrate PyCodemark in CI pipelines with SARIF reporting.
Example workflow file: .github/workflows/codemark.yml

Runs PyCodemark on every push or pull request

Uploads SARIF results to GitHub for code scanning

Provides automated code quality checks

Configuration

Configure PyCodemark via pyproject.toml:
```toml
[tool.pycodemark]
max_line_length = 88
rules = ["PEP8", "clarity", "docstrings"]
exclude = ["tests/", "migrations/"]
```

If you want, I can also provide a **one-liner command** so you can generate this README automatically on your Mac without manually copying it.  

Do you want me to do that next?
